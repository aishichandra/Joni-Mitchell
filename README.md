# Joni-Mitchell

### Lede Student Project

#### BACKGROUND
My initiation into Joni Mitchell’s music was through Parenthood when Lauren Graham and Mae Whitman sing "The Circle Game", as their characters contemplate motherhood, growing up, and change. Ever since, I started noticing how more and more music directors started referring to Joni to accompany their characters in pivotal moments of heartbreak, reflection, love, and longing. In this project, I look at how Joni Mitchell’s music has been used over time in visual media to confirm my observation that there is a rise in Joni Mitchell’s popularity in pop culture.

### TOOLS USED
To do this analysis, I scraped IMDB using <b>Beautiful Soup</b> and manually pulled from several other web sources to consolidate a list of soundtrack credits, categorizing them into three broad categories (TV Series, Movies, TV Performances), and eight subcategories (Long-Form TV series, Mini-Series, Movies (Fiction), Documentaries, TV Movie, Shorts, Talk Show, TV Special).
Using <b>Python,</b> I calculated the moving average of the number of appearances across time to create a trend line. The graph was created on <b>RawGraphs</b>, exported as a SVG into <b>Adobe Illustrator</b> and edited there. The last graph was created on <b>Tableau.</b> I drew the header image on <b>Adobe Photoshop</b> with my <b>Wacom Tablet</b>
